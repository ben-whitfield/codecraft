# Codecraft Exercise

## Purpose
This repo generates a scaleable, scrolling 7 segment clock which is fixed to the current time. This is output to the terminal.

## How
Run from a node prompt (i.e. node index.js) and pass a numerical argument after this for the size of the clock.
e.g.
`node index.js 2`
