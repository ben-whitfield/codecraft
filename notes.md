# Notes to myself about the challenge

## Add a new argument that sets the size of the rendered contents. 
Segments can now not be a fixed list and they will need to be generated

Spotted that there is a mathematical relationship which should be exploited rather than adding multiple versions of the numbers - will require some refactoring on how the functions are called (as it was based on a fixed loop size)

Needed a complete refactor :-( 

Computation time will increase considerably on larger numbers
